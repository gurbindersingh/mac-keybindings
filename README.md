# Mac Keybindings
Do you use a Mac and Windows PC? Do you constantly have to switch between the two? Does your muscle memory get constantly interrupted by the switching? Does your head hurt from doing so? 

Well, fret no more. This repo contains an AutoHotkey script as well as some PowerToys settings to simulate the Mac keybindings and shortcuts on Windows!

> This repo is still very much a work in progress.
